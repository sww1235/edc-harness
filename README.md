# Every Day Carry (EDC) Harness

The goal of this project is to provide a backbone on which my EDC electronics
can be connected and charged while reducing weight and awkwardness.

Some components of this will be in separate github repositories as listed below.
The words are clicky below and will take you to the listed part.

-   [Mixer](https://github.com/sww1235/portable-line-mixer)
-   [Batteries](https://github.com/sww1235/portable-liIon-battery-pack)

## Idea list

-   have external power connections for flashlights or other things
-   batteries are mounted in/on hip strap
-   radios and other electronics are mounted on vertical shoulder straps of
    harness



### Helmet

-   LED forward and rear lights
-   headset and boom mic (maybe on chin strap)
-   custom connector between harness wiring and helmet
    -   2x4 pogo pin SLC connector and target (8 pins in total-4 audio, 4 lighting)
    -   custom 3D printed housing at first, potentially milled
        plastic/metal housing later
    -   heatshrink for cable strain relief

### Harness and Pack

**TODO:** figure out what type of connectors to use for hip and shoulder
pack-harness connections

-   Backpack style harness
    -   large padded hip strap
    -   sternum strap
    -   padded shoulder straps
-   Pack clips to harness to create a *normal* looking backpack
    -   long shoulder straps to allow easier attachment to harness. Ideal is
        that pack is picked up by top handle and one strap is brought over
        shoulder. This is secured to front of hip strap temporarily or just
        held, then the hip connections are made with one hand, then the pack
        shoulder straps are connected to the top of the harness shoulder straps.
    -   pack has integrated frame like backpacking pack, with potential to mount
        pipe similar in diameter to bicycle handlebar to top as mounting point
        for antennae and extra lights.
