# Every Day Carry (EDC) Harness

The goal of this project is to provide a backbone on which my EDC electronics
can be connected and charged while reducing weight and awkwardness.

Some components of this will be in separate github repositories as listed below.
The words are clicky below and will take you to the listed part.
